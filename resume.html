          <h4>ORBCOMM | Embedded Software Developer</h4>
          <i><p>January 2017 - April 2017 | Ottawa, ON</p></i>
          <p>For my latest co-op term I worked as an embedded software developer
          for ORBCOMM - a big player in the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and
          Internet-of-Things (IoT) space. While there, my main project
          was to spearhead the transition of our terminal application software
          from our legacy hardware to our next generation products. This
          involved porting Lua 5.1 code to a Lua 5.3 platform, refactoring
          old code, addressing outstanding tickets and implementing
          automated builds and testing using Jenkins.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          Near the end of the term I also got a chance to work on another
          project. For this project my task was to implement a file upload
          feature which would allow for over-the-air firmware upgrades.
          I was working on an embedded web server running on a
          FRDM-K66F board. The jump to C was certainly a big one, but
          a much welcome change from the carefree nature of Lua.

          <h4>Ravens Racing | Powertrain Team Member</h4>
          <i><p>January 2017 - April 2017 | Carleton University</p></i>
          <p> Going to a new city meant I didn't know very many people going
          in. What better way to fix this than to join a student design team?
          Ravens Racing is a student run team at Carleton University, whose
          goal is to design and build a formula style race car. As part of the
          powertrain subteam, I dealt with the heart of the car: the engine. I
          took part in the tuning and maintenance of the engine, dynamometer
          and some of the final drive components.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          I also spent many late nights in the machine shop making all sorts
          of parts of the car. This work involved the use of a lathe, mill,
          all sorts of handtools, and even welding! In May, we'll be going to
          Michigan in order to compete in the Formula SAE Michigan competition,
          where 120 teams from around the world will see who built the best car.

          <h4>Waterloop | EC Brakes/Electrical Team Member</h4>
          <i><p> September 2016 - December 2016 | University of Waterloo</p></i>
          <p> The Hyperloop is the so called fifth mode of transportation,
          described by Elon Musk in his 2013 white paper.
          Musk's SpaceX decided to host a design competion, in which teams
          from around the world built half-scale prototypes of their pod. The
          University of Waterloo's team was one of 30 teams that went to
          Hawthrone, California to compete.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          I started off my work on the Waterloop team with the Eddy Current
          Braking system. I designed a bracket to hold a linear actuator within
          the brakes, as well as manufacturing magnet mounts. Eventually I
          transitioned into doing more electrical
          work. As an Electrical member of the team, I did lots of soldering
          and sourcing of parts. I also did a bit of schematic work using
          Eagle, which is something I want to do more of in the future.

          <p>Within the University Health Network I worked for the Princess
          Margaret Genomics Centre. While there, I worked a lot with the MEAN
          (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) stack, developing applications
          for researchers, research groups, and lab technicians. I also deployed
          and maintained an OpenID Connect server, which is to be used by client
          applications from institutes across the country. At the end of the co-op
          term I recived an 'outstanding' review for my work, which is the
          highest review available to Waterloo co-op students.</p>

          <p>I found myself with some extra time after work during the co-op
          term, so I decided to go out and find something to do. I ended up
          joining this student design team, meeting with them several times a
          week. While there I worked with both of their teams: the VexU team,
          and the Mars Rover team. I did some prototyping for both teams, some
          testing of electrical components for the VexU team, and a lot of
          research of the Mars Rover team. On top of this I also participated
          on behalf of the club at information sessions, and helped around
          the shop building and fixing anything that came in.</p>
